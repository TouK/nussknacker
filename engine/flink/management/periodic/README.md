# Periodic scenarios deployment manager

An experimental engine running scenarios periodicly according to a schedule such as a cron expression.

When the deploy button is clicked in NK GUI, then the scenario is scheduled to be run in the future. When a scenario
should be run is described by a schedule, e.g. a cron expression set in scenario properties. During scenario scheduling,
deployment manager only prepares data needed to deploy scenario on a target engine (e.g. on Flink cluster).
scenario is deployed according to the schedule on the target engine. Periodic engine watches its completion. Afterwards
scenario is scheduled to be run again according to the schedule.

## Usage

- Implement `DeploymentManagerProvider` using `PeriodicDeploymentManagerProvider`. Following components need to provided:
  - Underlying engine, currently only Flink is supported.
  - Optional `SchedulePropertyExtractorFactory` to determine how to construct an instance of a periodic property. By default
    a cron expression set in scenario properties is used to describe when a scenario should be run.
  - Optional `ProcessConfigEnricherFactory` if you would like to extend scenario configuration, by default nothing is done.
  - Optional `PeriodicProcessListenerFactory` to take some actions on scenario lifecycle.
  - Optional `AdditionalDeploymentDataProvider` to inject additional deployment parameters.
- Add service provider with your `DeploymentManagerProvider` implementation.
