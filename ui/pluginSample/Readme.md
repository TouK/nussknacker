This is very simple plugin, which provides 'vanilla' text input for literal expressions. 
Input can have different default values, to show how to configure plugin from application.conf.

To run in IDE (e.g. Intellij) you have to use server/develConf/pluginSample configuration and use pluginSample
module as classpath (with provided dependencies) as plugins have to be in main classloader of application.
