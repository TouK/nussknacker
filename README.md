Nussknacker lets you design, deploy and monitor real time decision algorithms with easy to use GUI.

For stateless use cases we provide lightweight, but scalable and performant engine deploying to Kubernetes. 
When more advanced, stateful scenarios are needed we can leverage the power and reliability of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) 
to make your processes fast and accurate.

## Quickstart

If you want to see Nussknacker in action without any other dependencies, you can use embedded engine in Request-response mode (scenario logic is exposed with REST API), just run:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8181:8181 -e DEFAULT_SCENARIO_TYPE=request-response-embedded touk/nussknacker:latest
```
After it started go to http://localhost:8080 and login using credentials: admin/admin.
REST endpoints of deployed scenarios will be exposed at `http://localhost:8181/scenario/<slug>`. Slug is defined in Properties, and by default it is scenario name.
Be aware that some things (e.g. metrics) will not work, and this engine is not intended for production use.

If you want to follow step-by-step via more complex tutorials, based on production ready engines, read one of quickstart guides for: [Streaming mode on Lite engine](https://nussknacker.io/documentation/quickstart/lite-streaming)
or [Streaming mode on Flink engine](https://nussknacker.io/documentation/quickstart/flink) or [Request-response mode on Lite engine](https://nussknacker.io/documentation/quickstart/lite-request-response).

## Scala compatibility

Currently, we do support Scala 2.12 and 2.13, we cross publish versions. Default Scala version is 2.13. Docker images (both Designer and Lite Runtime) are tagged with `_scala-2.X` suffix (e.g. `1.8.0_scala_2.13` or `latest_2.12`). 
Tags without such suffix are also published, and they point to images with default Scala version build. Please be aware of that, especially if you use `latest` image tag.

## Flink compatibility

We currently support only one Flink version (more or less the latest one, please see flinkV in build.sbt). 
However, it should be possible to run Nussknacker with older Flink version. 

While we don't provide out-of-the-box
support as it would complicate the build process, there is separate [repo](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker-flink-compatibility)
with detailed instructions how to run Nussknacker with some of the older versions.
