# Nussknacker

Nussknacker lets you design, deploy and monitor streaming processes using easy to use GUI.
We leverage power, performance and reliability of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) to make your processes fast and accurate.

Visit our [pages](https://nussknacker.io/documentation) to see documentation.
Visit our [quickstart](https://nussknacker.io/documentation/quickstart/docker/) to have a look around.

## Demo

Available at [demo.nussknacker.io](https://demo.nussknacker.io)

## Scala compatibility

Currently we do support Scala 2.12, we will cross publish when Flink supports Scala >= 2.13.

## Flink compatibility

We currently support only one Flink version (more or less latest one, please see flinkV in build.sbt). 
However, it should be possible to run Nussknacker with older Flink version. 

While we don't provide out-of-the-box
support as it would complicate the build process, there is separate [repo](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker-flink-compatibility)
with detailed instructions how to run Nussknacker with some of the older versions.
