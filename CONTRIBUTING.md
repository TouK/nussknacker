## Setting up development environment

- JDK >= 9 is needed - we have specified target java version to java 8, but using some compiler flags available only on JDK >= 9 (--release flag)
- For working on engine - standard `sbt` setup should be enough
- For working/running GUI please see `ui/README.md` for details instructions

## Java interoperability

The Nussknacker project is developed in Scala, but we want to keep API interoperable with Java in most of places.
Below you can find out some hints how to achieve that:
- Use abstract classes instead of traits in places where the main inheritance tree is easy to recognize
- Don't use package objects. If you need to have more classes in one file, prefer using files with name as a root class
  and subclasses next to root class or class with non-package object
- Be careful with abstract types - in some part of API will be better to use generics instead
- Be careful with `ClassTag`/`TypeTag` - should be always option to pass simple `Class[_]` or sth similar
- Prefer methods intead of function members (def foo: (T) => R)
- Avoid using AnyVal if the class is in API that will be used from Java

## Changelog
            
All significant changes should be added to [Changelog](docs/Changelog.md). All changes which break API compatibility 
should be added to [Migration guide](docs/MigrationGuide.md)

## Keeping documentation up to date

New features, components should have appropriate [Documentation](docs). In particular, all settings 
should be documented (with type, default values etc.) in appropriate sections of 
[configuration guide](docs/installation_configuration_guide/Configuration.md).
