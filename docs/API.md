#Intro
Before designing processes you have to define the model. The model is made of:
- data structures
- services used to access external systems
- event sources and sinks

#Defining and discovering model
Classes of your model should be packed in a jar together with an implementation of [`ProcessConfigCreator`](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker/blob/master/engine/api/src/main/scala/pl/touk/nussknacker/engine/api/process/ProcessConfigCreator.scala). This trait defines nodes which would be used to build processes. Nussknacker accesses your model using your implementation of `ProcessConfigCreator`.

```scala
package pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.process

...

trait ProcessConfigCreator extends Serializable {

  def customStreamTransformers(config: Config): Map[String, WithCategories[CustomStreamTransformer]]

  def services(config: Config) : Map[String, WithCategories[Service]]

  def sourceFactories(config: Config): Map[String, WithCategories[SourceFactory[_]]]

  def sinkFactories(config: Config): Map[String, WithCategories[SinkFactory]]

  def listeners(config: Config): Seq[ProcessListener]

  def exceptionHandlerFactory(config: Config) : ExceptionHandlerFactory

  def expressionConfig(config: Config): ExpressionConfig
  
  def buildInfo(): Map[String, String]

  def signals(config: Config): Map[String, WithCategories[ProcessSignalSender]]

  def asyncExecutionContextPreparer(config: Config): Option[AsyncExecutionContextPreparer] = None

  def classExtractionSettings(config: Config): ClassExtractionSettings = ClassExtractionSettings.Default

}
```

##Making your model jar discoverable
Nussknacker uses [ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) to register your model. When you package the jar please add the file `META-INF/services/pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.process.ProcessConfigCreator` containing FQN of class implementing`ProcessConfigCreator` interface. Exactly one implementation have to be provided. Any other case will result in throwing an exception.

##Categories
Each process is assigned to exactly one category. Each node can be accessible in many categories. Category defines if a node is accessible in process. 

#Creating sources and sinks

##Source
To create source one needs to extend `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.process.SourceFactory` interface and annotate single method with `@MethodToInvoke` and return `Source[T]`.

Nussknacker comes with Kafka source `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.kafka.KafkaSourceFactory` which uses `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaConsumer09` underneath. 


Let's see how it works:
```scala
class KafkaSourceFactory[T: TypeInformation](config: KafkaConfig,
                                             schema: DeserializationSchema[T],
                                             val timestampAssigner: Option[TimestampAssigner[T]],
                                             ...) extends FlinkSourceFactory[T] with Serializable {
  @MethodToInvoke
  def create(processMetaData: MetaData, @ParamName("topic") topic: String): Source[T] with TestDataGenerator = {
    ...
    new KafkaSource(consumerGroupId = processMetaData.id, topic = topic)
  }
}
```

First let's look at constructor params. `config` and `schema` is pretty straightforward. `timestampAssigner` extracts event time from events, so Flink knows event time that can be used in aggregations. Event Time is Flink's crucial concept, see [Event Time](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-{{book.flinkMajorVersion}}/dev/event_time.html). 
`Metadata` parameter is injected by Nussknacker and `topic` is just a normal parameter that user can set in UI.

### Source test data
To be able to test process with data from a file `SourceFactory.testDataParser: Option[TestDataParser[T]]` methods have to be implemented.

`Source` can also specify how test data is generated using Nussknacker's `generate` button in `Test` section of the right panel - see [Quickstart section](Quickstart.md) for details. Data generation logic is provided by extending `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.process.TestDataGenerator`. See `KafkaSourceFactory` implementation for details.

##Sink
`Sink` creation is similar to `Source` creation. You extend `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.process.SinkFactory` interface and annotate single method with `@MethodToInvoke` and return `Sink`. Nussknacker comes with kafka sink `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.kafka.KafkaSinkFactory` which uses `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer09` underneath. 

#Creating Service
To create service you have to extend `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.Service` interface and annotate single method with `@MethodToInvoke` and return `scala.concurrent.Future` (method name is not important). Annotated method will be invoked by Nussknacker for every element passing through this service. Service can do anything - it could be external API call or some static mapping.

Services come in two flavours - processors and enrichers. Processor does not return anything and enricher returns some value. So to be classified as `Processor` annotated method has to return `Future[Unit]` in other case service will be classified as `Enricher`.

Sample enricher looks like this:
```scala
class ClientService extends Service {
  @MethodToInvoke
  def invoke(@ParamName("clientId") clientId: String)
            (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, metaData: MetaData): Future[Client] = {
    val clients = Map(
      "1" -> Client("1", "Alice", "123"), 
      "2" -> Client("1", "Bob", "234") 
    )
    Future { clients.get(clientId) }
  }
}
```
Every non-implicit parameter should be annotated with `@ParamName` - value from annotation will be used in UI to display parameter name. You have full control over non-implicit parameters, on the other hand implicit parameters are injected by Nussknacker.

Apart from parameters - non-implicit and annotated with `@ParamName` you can also have certain implicit parameters in signature of `@MethodToInvoke`. They are optional - you can put any of them in a method signature, but you don't have to.

They are:
* `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext` - useful for e.g. invoking asynchronous external services
* `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.MetaData` - if you want to e.g. have process name passed to external services
* `pl.touk.nussknacker.engine.api.test.ServiceInvocationCollector` - used in test mode, see next paragraph

## Service in tests from file
Service in tests can behave as in production, but sometimes it seems wrong or impractical - for example when service sends mail. So Nussknacker gives you control to decide how your service behaves during tests from file.

Here's an example:

```scala
class SendMailProcessor extends Service {
  @MethodToInvoke
  def invoke(@ParamName("mailAddress") mailAddress: String)
            (implicit ex: ExecutionContext, collector: ServiceInvocationCollector): Future[Unit] = {
    Future {
      if (collector.collectorEnabled) {
        collector.collect(s"We are in test mode! Pretend to send mail to ${mailAddress}")
      } else {
        sendMail(mailAddress)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`SendMailProcessor` uses `ServiceInvocationCollector` which is enabled in test mode. 
Collected value can be seen in UI in mocked service after tests, so for example you can use `collector.collect()` to collect HTTP request that you would normally send in production.

##Lazy values (use with caution)
Instead of using `Enricher` node in graph to enrich data, one can use some syntactic sugar to enrich data in more object-oriented way - it is possible to inject enricher into model class. 

Here's an example.

So let's say we defined `ClientService` as in above, and then we passed it into `ProcessConfigCreator`:
```scala
class MyProcessConfigCreator extends ProcessConfigCreator {
    ...
    override def services(config: Config): Map[String, WithCategories[Service]] = {
        Map("clientService" -> all(new ClientService))
    }
    ...
}
```
To enrich model, which we assume is `Transaction` with `clientId` field, normally we would put `Enricher` in UI graph, but instead you can inject enricher:
```scala
case class Transaction(clientId: String) extends UsingLazyValues {
  lazy val client = lazyValue[Client]("clientService", "clientId" -> clientId)
}
```
After that you'll able to access `client` in expression like this `#input.client` - so potential HTTP call is made behind the scenes, but user cannot really distinguish it from usual field access.
