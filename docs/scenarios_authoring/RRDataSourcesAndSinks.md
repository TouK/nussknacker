# Request-Response sources and sinks

## Http request as input and output to Nussknacker scenarios

### Concepts

In Request-Response mode you interact with Nussknacker Lite runtime engine in a similar way as with any "server" in the
Internet. You send request which contains request parameters and you get response from the server. The protocol for this
communication is HTTP - the same protocol is used by browsers when they communicate with web servers. One of the
differences is that the content of the communication with the Nussknacker Lite engine ("the server") is encoded as JSON,
not HTML. Not very surprisingly, in Request-Response processing mode the only possible Source component is Request and
the only Sink component is Response.

## Request-Response schema

Each scenario needs to define two schemas
in [JSON Schema](/docs/integration/DataTypingAndSchemasHandling.md#json-schema) format:

- Input schema
- Output schema

Nussknacker uses these schemas to detect how
the [request and response should look like](/docs/integration/DataTypingAndSchemasHandling.md#overview). Input and
Output params are available on scenario properties.

## Request-Response source

Thanks to the [Input schema](#request-response-schema) Nussknacker knows what data to expect in the request, so it will
hint field names and will perform additional validations on SpEL expressions involving data from the selected topic.

## Request-Response sink

The `response` sink configuration form will show a list of fields defined in [Output schema](#request-response-schema).

If, instead of filling separate autogenerated fields, you prefer to define the whole response as one expression
containing value of the HTTP response, you can do that by switching `Raw editor` to `true`.

When using the Raw editor, you can choose
the [validation mode](/docs/integration/DataTypingAndSchemasHandling.md#validation-and-encoding).
