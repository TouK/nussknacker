# Designer Tips and Tricks


## Prerequisites

Please try [Nussknacker demo](/quickstart/Demo) to quickly understand how to move around Nussknacker Designer and create a simple scenario.


### Tips and Tricks

> We have decided to change some terms we use to refer to concepts or parts of Nussknacker. One of the changes we made is to replace term *process* with term *[scenario](/about/GLOSSARY/#scenario)*. Because the Nussknacker version published in Github still uses *process* term, the description below uses term *process*. Once we refactor Nussknacker Designer, we will update this page accordingly.

While Designer GUI in most cases is self explanatory and forgiving, there are a few features which may be not so obvious to guess:

* **Process name change**- click Properties icon in the process panel, enter the name, click OK, click Save icon to save the process.
* **Selecting nodes** - use Shift button and left mouse button to select nodes. If you expand the selection area rightward, you need to fully mark node icons; alternatively you can mark node icons partially if you expand the selection area leftward.
* **Copy & paste** - you can copy and paste selected nodes; just ensure that your browser has access to the clipboard for the Nussknacker site you use.
* **Panels in the Designer** - there are several panels on the left and right side of the process authoring canvass. You can move these panels and collapse them. You can always restore default layout using "reset" button in the View panel.
* **Process versioning** - whenever a process is saved, a new version is created. You can revert to the older version of the process (see Versions panel). Adding comments when saving a process may help to find the right version.
* **Deleting a process** - processes can be archived and unarchived, they are never completely deleted. 
* **Inserting a node into the flow** - you can drop a node on the edge connecting nodes and Designer will fit it into the flow.
