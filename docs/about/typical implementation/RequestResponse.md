title: Typical implementation - Request-Response
---

The diagram below shows architecture of a typical Nussknacker deployment in Request-Response mode. It shows not only 
components provided or needed by Nussknacker, 
but also elements of broader service architecture. 

![Typical request response implementation](../img/typical_implementation_requestresponse.png)

The following paragraphs briefly explain the role of the architectural components in Nussknacker deployment. 
   
- **Nussknacker** - allows to author, deploy and monitor real-time decision scenarios. More on its capabilities can be 
found [here](../Overview.md).

- **Runtime engine** - Once authored, scenarios are deployed to the Lite engine for processing; Each service is deployed 
  as K8s Service, exposing REST API. 

- **Upstream services** - Other services communicating with Nussknacker via REST API

- **Enrichment data** - Nussknacker reads enrichment data from databases, OpenAPI services, ML models etc.

The Nussknacker scenario design information is used to send runtime metrics from runtime engine to Influx DB.
   
- **InfluxDB** - a high-performing time series database, metrics generated by scenario engine are stored here. 

- **Grafana** - open source analytics and interactive visualization web application, scenario metrics stored in InfluxDB 
are visualized as a Grafana dashboard.
