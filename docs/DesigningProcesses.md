#Designing processes with UI 

In this section you will learn how to create Nussknacker processes using defined model. In the examples we'll 
  use sample model that comes with Nussknacker distribution. You can find latest sources [here](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker/tree/master/engine/example/src/main/scala/).
  
If you want to learn how to develop your own model, please see [API section](API.md)  

###Global process properties
These include:
* parallelism (see [Flink docs](https://flink.apache.org/faq.html#what-is-the-parallelism-how-do-i-set-it))
* checkpoint interval (see [Flink docs](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-{{book.flinkMajorVersion}}/setup/checkpoints.html))
* should state be kept in memory, or should RocksDB be used (see [Flink docs](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-{{book.flinkMajorVersion}}/ops/state_backends.html))
* properties for configuring ExceptionHandler of model

###Process variables
At beginning there is only one variable - `input`, contains single record for processing.

###Expressions

Currently expressions in Nussknacker can be written using Spring Expression Language.
 You can find extensive documentation 
 [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html).

#Basic nodes

Node works with data stream.
It can produce, fetch, send, collect data or organize data flow.


Each node has at least two parameters: `Id` and `Description`. 
Id has to be unique in process. It identifies node usage.
Description is just comment for node.

Depends on type, node could have input and output. 
Input if exists has to have exactly one assigned flow from another node.
Output could have multiple flows, or none, or could have at least one obligatory.


## Filter 
Filter passes records which satisfies its condition.
It can have one or two outputs.
First output is for records satisfying the condition, second (optional) is for others.
![filter graph](img/filter_graph.png)
Records from `source` which meets condition go to `true sink`, and others go to `false sink`. 

![filter graph single](img/filter_graph_single.png)

Records from `source` which meets condition go to `blue sink`, and others are filtered out. 

### Parameters
![filter window](img/filter_window.png)
There are two parameters: `Expression`, and `Disabled`.

Expression is written in SpEL. Should be evaluated to logical value. 
Outgoing data flow depends on expression result.


Disabled has logical value. 
If is checked, expression isn't evaluated, and returns value `true`.         
### Flow
Has input and one or two outputs. 

If there is one output, only outgoing pipe is named `true`, 
and each record which expression evaluates to true passes.
Otherwise record is gone.

If there are two outputs, one pipe is named `true` and another `false`.
Each record which expression evaluates to `true` goes to `true` pipe,
and other record goes to `false` pipe.  

##Split 
It doesn't have additional parameters.
Each output receives all records and processes them independently. 
![split graph](img/split_graph.png)

Every record from `source` go to `sink 1` and `sink 2`.
![filter window](img/split_window.png)

###Flow
Have at least one output.
Each output has same record as input, so all outputs are identical.

##Switch
Distributes incoming data between outputs. 
![split graph](img/switch_graph.png)
Each record form `source` is tested against condition defined on edge. 
If `color` is `blue` record goes to `blue sink`. 
If `color` is `green` record goes to `green sink`. 
For every other value record goes to `sink for others`.

### Parameters 
![split graph](img/switch_window.png)

There are two important parameters `Expression` and `exprVal`.
`Expression` contains expression which is evaluated for each record,
 and expression value is assigned to variable named like `exprVal` value.
 
 In `Switch` node edges can be of one of two types.
 
![split graph](img/switch_edge_condition.png)

 Edge of `Type` `Condition` has `Expression`. 
 Record go to first output which condition it matches.

![split graph](img/switch_edge_default.png)

 There can be at most one edge of `Type` `Default`,
  and it gets all records that doesn't match to any `Condition` edge. 

### Flow
For each record from input switch `Expression` is evaluated and result is assigned to `exprVal` variable.
After that records are tested against condition `Expressions` from output edges one by one.
Record goes to first output which condition it satisfies.
If record doesn't match any conditional output, and default output exists, record goes to default output.
Otherwise mismatching record is filtered out.

## Variable
Evaluates `Expression`, and assigns to `Variable Name.`

![split graph](img/variable_graph.png)

Doesn't change records flow. 
Have to have exactly one output.
Variable once defined cannot be overwritten.  

![split graph](img/variable_window.png)
  
## Map Variable 

Defines new variable with one or more fields. 
Each field value is evaluated by using `Expression`.  

![split graph](img/variable_object_window.png)

Doesn't change records flow. MapVariable once defined cannot be overwritten.  

###Subprocesses
Subprocesses let you abstract common used parts of process.
See [subprocesses](Subprocesses.md) for more detailed description of how they work.

###Using custom transformers

Sometimes basic building blocks are not enough - you may want to code custom aggregations or other
statuful processing in Flink. 
See below for more detailed guide:
