# Machine Learning (Enterprise only)

Nussknacker can infer ML models using the Machine Learning enrichers. The ML enrichers are Enterprise components of Nussknacker and require a separate license. Please contact <info@nussknacker.io> for license terms and more details.

We support the inference of the following ML technologies:
- native Python models discovered using the [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) model registry and executed with our ML runtime
- models exported in the [PMML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language) format
- models exported in the [H2O](https://h2o.ai/) format
