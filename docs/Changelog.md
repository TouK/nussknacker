Project status
==============
Nussknacker is production ready - it's been used in major Polish telcom since beginning of 2017. However, it's still
under active development, so some parts of the API may change in the future.

For detailed instructions how to migrate to the newest version please see [migration guide](MigrationGuide.md).
